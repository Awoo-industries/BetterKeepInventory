#bStats (https://bStats.org) collects some basic information for plugin authors, like how
#many people use their plugin and their total player count. It's recommended to keep bStats
#enabled, but if you're not comfortable with this, you can turn this setting off. There is no
#performance penalty associated with having metrics enabled, and data sent to bStats is fully
#anonymous.
